# Population Growth Calculator
This is a Python program that calculates the approximate population growth of organisms over a period of time. The user inputs the starting number of organisms, the average daily population increase, and the number of days that the organisms will be left to multiply for. The program then outputs a table that displays the approximate population for each day.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.
Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the cloned directory.
Run the program using the command python population_growth_calculator.py.

## Usage
Enter the starting number of organisms.
Enter the average daily population increase as a percentage. For example, 30 means 30%.
Enter the number of days that the organisms will be left to multiply for.
The program will output a table that displays the approximate population for each day.
Note: The program will validate the input and request the user to input a new value if the input is negative, zero, or outside of the allowed range.

## Example
Enter the starting number of organisms: 100
Enter the average daily population increase (number will be translated to percent value, for example, 30 means 30%): 30
Enter the number of days the organism will multiply for: 7
