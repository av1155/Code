# Gravity Calculator

This is a simple Java program that calculates the speed and distance of an object falling under gravity for given time intervals.

## Getting Started

To run the program, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/gravity-calculator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
`cd gravity-calculator`
3. Compile the Java source code.
`javac Gravity.java`
4. Run the program.
`java Gravity`

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input travel times and view the calculated speed and distance.

## Usage

- The program prompts you to enter travel times in seconds and then calculates the speed and distance for each time interval.
