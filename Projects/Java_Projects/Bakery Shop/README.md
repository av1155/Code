# Dana's Bakery - Order Calculator

## Overview

Dana's Bakery Order Calculator is a simple Java program that helps customers calculate the total cost of their bakery orders. It allows users to select pastries, coffees, sandwiches, and loaves, and then calculates the subtotal, tax, and total cost based on their selections.

## How it Works

The program follows these steps:

1. Displays a welcome message and the prices of various bakery items (pastries, coffees, sandwiches, and loaves).
2. Prompts the user to enter the quantity of each item they want to order.
3. Calculates the subtotal amount based on the quantity and prices of selected items.
4. Applies a 7% tax rate to the subtotal to calculate the tax amount.
5. Calculates the total amount by adding the subtotal and tax.
6. Displays the calculated subtotal, tax, and total cost.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the quantity of each item you want to order.
3. The program will display the subtotal, tax, and total cost of your order.
